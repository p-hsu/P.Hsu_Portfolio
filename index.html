            <p>Feeling a nagging need for a career change, I decided to pivot my trajectory from the veterinary field (as a technician) to the web developer field. As noted above, I am currently a student and so far have enjoyed learning about this new world of programming. Seeing the interactive world through this different persepctive brings about entirely new levels of thinking and creativity. I look forward to updating this portfolio page as my adventure continues to progress.</p>
            <p>When I am not in school or working, I enjoy spending time with my partner and cat, rock climbing, cooking and baking.</p>
