            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                Feeling a nagging need for a career change, I decided to pivot my trajectory from the veterinary field (as a technician) to the web developer field. I am currently enrolled in a full-stack bootcamp program through <a href="https://www.trilogyed.com/" target="_blank">Triology Education Services</a> at <a href="https://bootcamp.tlcenter.wustl.edu/" target="_blank">Washington University</a> here in Saint Louis, Missouri.
            </p>    
            <p>    
                I am enjoying learning about this new world of programming and all the opportunities it has to offer. Seeing the interactive world through this different persepctive brings about entirely new levels of thinking and creativity. I look forward to updating this portfolio page as my adventure continues to progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I am not in school or working, I enjoy spending time with my partner and cat, rock climbing, cooking and baking, and tyring to relearn Chinese.
