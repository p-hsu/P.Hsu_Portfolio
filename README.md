# P.Hsu_Portfolio

## Creating a personalized class-portfolio

This portfolio contains HTML and CSS built from scratch to display the progression of my work as a bootcamp student. 

### Aspects that were worked into this first draft of the portfolio include the following:

1. navigational links lead to the corresponding webpage section
2. a "featured" display of my first deployed project with a live link
3. use of flex-box to create an initial layer of a responsive webpage
4. use of `@media` to create the secondary layer of a responsice webpage
5. clean and efficient HTML independent of CSS
6. proper structrual framework building of both HTML and CSS

## Installation

1. Clone this repository onto local workspace
2. Open Terminal (MacOS) or Git Bash (Windows) and change location to where you want the cloned directory
3. Type `git clone` and paste copied respository
4. Directory should include the following:
    * `index.html`
    * `resume.html` : as a mock webpage link
    * `style.css` and images included in the assets folder
    * `README.md`
